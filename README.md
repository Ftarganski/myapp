## About the Project
All the code was generated by AI for a Tech Talks presentation at Droz. The entire project, from the initialization script, was AI-generated, and no edits were made to the code.
Additionally, the prezi presentation and behind-the-scenes videos were also generated using AI tools and were not edited by humans.
